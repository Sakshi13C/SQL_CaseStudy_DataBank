**Business Task** <br> 

Danny launched a new initiative, Data Bank which runs banking activities and also acts as the worldâ€™s most secure distributed data storage platform!  <br>
Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts.  <br>

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!  <br> <br>
